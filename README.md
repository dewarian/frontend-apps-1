# üëã Welcome to Functional-programming!
_The repo is used for the course functional programming; throughout this course, the wiki is actively updated with new (daily or weekly) content._

## üìì In short (description)
This course is in partnership with [de Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/), a dutch newsagency that distributes their paper digitally as physically. We're making a visualization using one of their datasets; this visualization might get included in their publications. This repo will contian code and documentation for this project as well as sample code and its documentation in the wiki. Furthermore, the project will transform raw data into clean data, and then visualize it using [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3). 

**Live demo:** [Link](http://functional-programming.vercel.app/)

## üîé Research 
[See the wiki for a complete version](https://github.com/sjagoori/functional-programming/wiki/%F0%9F%94%8E-Research)

### Research question
How diverse are the parking spaces in The Netherlands?? 

### Subquestion
* How are parking spaces dispersed?
* How many parking spaces facilitate disabled cars are in the Netherlands?
* Which provinces have the most parking spaces?

### Concept
Make a map with locations of each parkinspace that also displays the parkingspaces that displays disabled-friendly parkingspaces. There will also be a barchart displaying the amount of parkingspaces in each city as well as a piechart displaying the ratio between disabled-friendly and regular parkingspaces.

## ü§ñ Installation
**Run the project:**
1. Install dependencies
`npm install`
2. Run project
`npm run dev`
