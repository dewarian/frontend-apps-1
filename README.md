# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Functional-programming!

The repo is used for the course functional programming; throughout this course, the wiki is actively updated with new (daily or weekly) content. 

Furthermore, this course is in partnership with [de Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/), a dutch newsagency that distributes their paper digitally as physically. We're making a visualization using one of their datasets; this visualization might get included in their publications.
