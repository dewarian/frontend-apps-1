# 👋 Welcome to Functional-programming!
_The repo is used for the course functional programming; throughout this course, the wiki is actively updated with new (daily or weekly) content._

## 📓 In short (description)
This course is in partnership with [de Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/), a dutch newsagency that distributes their paper digitally as physically. We're making a visualization using one of their datasets; this visualization might get included in their publications.

This project will transform raw data into clean data, and then visualize it using [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3).

## Research
