# 👋 Welcome to Functional-programming!
_The repo is used for the course functional programming; throughout this course, the wiki is actively updated with new (daily or weekly) content._

## 📓 In short (description)
This course is in partnership with [de Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/), a dutch newsagency that distributes their paper digitally as physically. We're making a visualization using one of their datasets; this visualization might get included in their publications.

This project will transform raw data into clean data, and then visualize it using [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3).

## Concepts
* What are the effects of the new green deals on older cars?
* How many people will be affected if the gas price goes up?
* Does the rise of electric cars affect/convince other car owners to make the switch?
* Does the Netherlands have enough charging stations if we switched to electric cars? 

## Research 
[See the wiki for a complete version](https://github.com/sjagoori/functional-programming/wiki/%F0%9F%94%8E-Research)

### Research question
How diverse are the registered vehicles in the Netherlands and how optimized are parking places for them?

### Subquestions
* What vehicle type are popular?
* What are popular brands?
* What are the prominent vehicle colors?
* What is the ratio of personal vehicles and taxis?
* What are the average build dates of vehicles?
